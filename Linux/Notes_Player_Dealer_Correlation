After analyzing the data from both the roulette player and dealer schedules, there were a total of 13 losses that occurred on March 10, 12, and 15th.
Mylie Schmidt was playing roulette at all of these times.
Billy Jones was the dealer at all of these times.
The fact that both were present during all 13 losses that occurred rises far beyond mere coincidence and is cause to further investigate these two individuals for conspiracy to commit fraud.
